# cloudinary-for-codeigniter
This repo demonstrates how to include the latest Cloudinary API PHP class into CodeIgniter 3 using a dummy library.  

This dummy library technique can be used to get around CodeIgniter 3's issues with loading libraries dependent on namespaces like Cloudinary's.

**This project is still very much in development**

** Master branch is the main branch. **

** Dev branch is the working branch.**
